Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0 points\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\n Total Score: 15\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer correctly identifies the object in the scene and provides a clear and logically structured reasoning for the prediction. However, it fails to match the correct answer, does not consider environmental conditions, and lacks clarity in addressing this aspect. Therefore, the total score is 15.",

Object recognition and location and orientation are partially accurate, earning a total of 5 points. However, there is no consideration for environmental conditions, resulting in 0 points. The reasoning is somewhat clear, but there are some issues with clarity and logical structure, resulting in 2 points. Overall, the predicted answer lacks precision and well-supported reasoning, resulting in a low score of 7/100.",
