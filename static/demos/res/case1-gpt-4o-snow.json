    "A": "The moving status of object (c2,CAM_FRONT,0.4651,0.5658) is most likely B. Going ahead.\n **Explanation:**\n - The coordinates (0.4651, 0.5658) place the object near the center of the image, which typically corresponds to the lane directly ahead.\n - The object appears to be aligned with the lane markings, indicating a forward motion rather than a turn.",

    "rubric-aware": "1. Answer Correctness (50 points): 0\n2. Object Recognition (10 points): 5\n3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points): 5\n4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0\n5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5\nTotal Score: 15\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. However, the object recognition, location, and orientation are accurately described, earning full points in those categories. The reasoning is clear and logically structured, contributing to a high score in Clarity of Reasoning. However, there is a lack of consideration for environmental conditions, resulting in a low score in that category. Overall, the explanation provides clear and accurate reasoning for the predicted answer, but the failure to match the correct answer significantly impacts the overall score.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 3\nTotal Score: 10\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. Object Recognition is lacking as the predicted answer does not accurately identify the object's moving status. Environmental Condition Awareness is also missing, and the Clarity of Reasoning is somewhat unclear. Overall, the predicted answer does not align with the correct answer and lacks important contextual considerations, resulting in a low score.",

However, the object recognition and location and orientation are well-described and accurate, earning full points in those categories. There is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in a score of 0 in that category. The clarity of reasoning is good, earning full points in that category. Overall, the explanation provides accurate object recognition and location details, but the incorrect predicted answer and lack of consideration for environmental conditions significantly impact the overall score."
