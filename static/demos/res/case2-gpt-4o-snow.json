    "A": "To determine the objects the ego vehicle should notice and the actions it should take, let's analyze the images:\n\n1. **First Object to Notice:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT\n   - **Object:** A pedestrian or obstruction in the path.\n   - **State:** The object appears stationary and directly in the path of the vehicle.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should slow down or stop to avoid a collision.\n\n2. **Second Object to Notice:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT_RIGHT\n   - **Object:** A parked vehicle.\n   - **State:** Stationary, parked on the side.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and proceed cautiously.\n\n3. **Third Object to Notice:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_BACK\n   - **Object:** Another vehicle approaching from behind.\n   - **State:** Moving towards the ego vehicle.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should be aware of the approaching vehicle and ensure it maintains a safe following distance.\n\nThese observations and actions are crucial for maintaining safety and ensuring smooth navigation in the given driving scenario.",

Recommended Action for Ego Vehicle (15 points): 5\n5. Logical Flow and Reasonableness of Prediction (20 points): 5\n6. Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 5\nTotal Score: 30\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not accurately identify the correct objects in the correct priority order as indicated in the question. The object category and visual description accuracy are also inaccurate. The state of the objects and the recommended actions for the ego vehicle are not aligned with the correct answer. The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are lacking, and there are grammatical errors and lack of clarity in the response. Overall, the predicted answer does not align with the correct answer and lacks accuracy and clarity.",
