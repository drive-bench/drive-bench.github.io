Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\nTotal Score: 13\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in 0 points for Answer Correctness. However, the object recognition and clarity of reasoning are strong, earning 5 points each. The object location and orientation are somewhat accurate, earning 3 points. However, there is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in 0 points for that criterion. Overall, the explanation is clear and logically structured, but the lack of correct answer and environmental condition awareness significantly impact the score.",
