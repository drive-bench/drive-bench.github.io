    "A": "To determine the sequence of objects the ego vehicle should notice, let's analyze the images:\n\n1. **First Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT\n   - **Object:** White van\n   - **State:** Stationary, partially blocking the path\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to navigate around the van if it is safe to do so.\n\n2. **Second Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_BACK\n   - **Object:** Approaching vehicle\n   - **State:** Moving towards the ego vehicle\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should be cautious and ensure there is enough space to maneuver safely, avoiding sudden stops.\n\n3. **Third Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT_LEFT\n   - **Object:** Black SUV\n   - **State:** Moving, potentially entering the path\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should yield if necessary and ensure the path is clear before proceeding.\n\nThese observations help ensure safe navigation by prioritizing potential obstacles and moving vehicles.",

Recommended Action for Ego Vehicle (15 points): 13\n5. Logical Flow and Reasonableness of Prediction (20 points): 17\n6. Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 9\nTotal Score: 84\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer accurately identifies the objects and their states, but there are some inaccuracies in the recommended actions for the ego vehicle. The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are generally good, but there are some minor grammatical errors and lack of clarity in the explanation. Overall, the predicted answer provides a reasonable and mostly accurate response, but there is room for improvement in clarity and recommended actions.",
