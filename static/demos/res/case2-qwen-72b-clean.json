The ego vehicle should **continue to monitor the van** as it approaches.\n 2. The ego vehicle should notice the **black SUV** second when getting to the next possible location. The state of the black SUV is **stationary**. The ego vehicle should **continue to monitor the SUV** as it approaches.\n 3. The ego vehicle should notice the **red SUV** third.

    "rubric-aware": "1. Object Identification and Priority Order (20 points): 10\n 2. Object Category and Visual Description Accuracy (20 points): 10\n 3. State of the Object (15 points): 5\n 4. Recommended Action for Ego Vehicle (15 points): 5\n 5. Logical Flow and Reasonableness of Prediction (20 points): 5\n 6. Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 5\n Total Score: 40\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer correctly identifies the objects but fails to prioritize them in the correct order as indicated in the question. The visual description accuracy is lacking, and the state of the objects is inaccurately described. The recommended actions for the ego vehicle are not aligned with the correct answer, and the logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are inconsistent. The clarity and grammar are also lacking, resulting in a low total score.",
