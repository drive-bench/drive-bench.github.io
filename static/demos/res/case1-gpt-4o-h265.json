    "A": "The moving status of object <c2,CAM_FRONT,0.4651,0.5658> is most likely B. Going ahead.\n\nExplanation: The object is positioned near the center of the image, which typically aligns with the direction of forward movement in a driving scenario. The orientation and alignment with the road markings suggest that the vehicle is proceeding straight ahead.",

    "rubric-aware": "1. Answer Correctness (50 points): 0 points\n 2. Object Recognition (10 points): 5 points\n 3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points): 5 points\n 4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0 points\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\n Total Score: 15\n\n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in 0 points for Answer Correctness. However, the object recognition, location and orientation, and clarity of reasoning are all well-supported and accurate, earning full points in those categories. There is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in a lower score. Overall, the explanation provides clear and logical reasoning, but the lack of correct answer alignment significantly impacts the total score.",
