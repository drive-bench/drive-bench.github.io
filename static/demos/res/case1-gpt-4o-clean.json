    "A": "The moving status of object (c2,CAM_FRONT,0.4651,0.5658) is B. Going ahead.\n\nExplanation: The object is positioned in the lane with a straight arrow marking, indicating it is moving straight ahead.",
    "baseline": "0",
    "rubric-aware": "1. Answer Correctness (50 points): 0 points\n 2. Object Recognition (10 points): 5 points\n 3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points): 5 points\n 4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0 points\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\n Total Score: 15\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer accurately identifies the object and its movement, as well as the environmental conditions and provides a clear and logically structured explanation. However, the predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a low score for answer correctness. Additionally, the environmental conditions are not adequately addressed, leading to a lower score in that category. Overall, the predicted answer demonstrates good object recognition, location, and orientation, as well as clarity of reasoning, but falls short in answer correctness and environmental condition awareness.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2 points\n Total Score: 7/100\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in 0 points for Answer Correctness. Object Recognition and Object Location and Orientation are partially accurate, earning a total of 5 points. However, there is no consideration for environmental conditions, resulting in 0 points. The clarity of reasoning is also lacking, earning 2 points. Overall, the predicted answer lacks precision, reasoning, and consideration of environmental factors, resulting in a low score of 7 out of 100.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2\n Total Score: 6\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. The object recognition, location, and orientation are minimally addressed, resulting in a low score. Environmental condition awareness is not considered, and the reasoning is not clear, leading to a low overall score of 6."
