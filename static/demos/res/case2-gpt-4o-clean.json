    "A": "To determine the sequence of objects the ego vehicle should notice and the corresponding actions, let's analyze the images:\n\n1. **First Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT\n   - **Object:** White van\n   - **State:** Stationary, parked on the right side.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, ensuring there is enough clearance to pass safely.\n\n2. **Second Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_BACK\n   - **Object:** Black vehicle (appears to be moving towards the ego vehicle)\n   - **State:** Approaching from behind.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should monitor the rear camera to ensure the vehicle maintains a safe distance and adjust speed if necessary.\n\n3. **Third Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT_LEFT\n   - **Object:** Black Jeep\n   - **State:** Stationary, parked on the left side.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should continue to monitor the surroundings for any pedestrians or vehicles that might emerge from the left side.\n\nThese observations and actions ensure the ego vehicle navigates safely through the environment.",

The recommended actions for the ego vehicle are generally appropriate, but there are some minor inaccuracies and lack of clarity in the response. The logical flow is reasonable, and the grammar is mostly clear, but there are a few areas where the explanation could be improved.",

The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are mostly consistent, but there are some inconsistencies. The clarity and grammar are generally good, but there are a few areas that could be improved for better coherence and readability."
