Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 3\n Total Score: 8\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. Object Recognition and Object Location and Orientation are partially accurate, earning a few points. However, there is no consideration for environmental conditions, resulting in a score of 0 for that criterion. The reasoning is somewhat clear, but there are some issues with grammar and structure, leading to a modest score for Clarity of Reasoning. Overall, the predicted answer lacks precision and fails to fully support the correct response, resulting in a low total score.",

Object Recognition, Object Location and Orientation, and Environmental Condition Awareness are all lacking in accuracy and detail, resulting in low scores. The Clarity of Reasoning is also poor, with a lack of clear, logically structured reasoning and grammatical accuracy. Overall, the predicted answer does not align well with the correct answer and lacks sufficient support in the other criteria, resulting in a low Total Score of 6.",
