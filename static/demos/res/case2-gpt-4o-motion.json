    "A": "To determine the objects the ego vehicle should notice and the actions it should take, let's analyze the images:\n\n1. **First Object to Notice:**\n   - **Image:** CAM_FRONT\n   - **Object:** White van\n   - **State:** Stationary, parked on the right side.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, ensuring there is enough clearance on the right side to avoid any potential obstacles or pedestrians.\n\n2. **Second Object to Notice:**\n   - **Image:** CAM_FRONT_RIGHT\n   - **Object:** Black SUV\n   - **State:** Stationary, parked.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and ensure that there is enough space to maneuver around the parked vehicle, checking for any pedestrians or other vehicles that might be moving.\n\n3. **Third Object to Notice:**\n   - **Image:** CAM_BACK\n   - **Object:** Approaching vehicle\n   - **State:** Moving towards the ego vehicle.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should be aware of the approaching vehicle from behind and ensure that any lane changes or stops are signaled appropriately to avoid collisions.\n\nThese observations help ensure safe navigation through the environment by prioritizing awareness of stationary and moving objects around the ego vehicle.",

The recommended actions for the ego vehicle are generally appropriate, but there are some inaccuracies and lack of detail. The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are mostly consistent, but there are some inconsistencies. The clarity and grammar are generally good, but there are some areas of ambiguity and lack of coherence. Overall, the predicted answer demonstrates a good understanding of the scene but lacks precision and detail in some areas.",

However, there are inaccuracies in the state of the objects and the recommended actions for the ego vehicle. The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are mostly consistent, but there are some inconsistencies. The clarity and grammar are generally good, but there are a few areas that could be improved for better coherence."
