Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 0\n Total Score: 10\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not accurately identify the objects or their priority order, and it fails to provide the correct state of the objects or the recommended actions for the ego vehicle. The logical flow and reasoning are also inconsistent with the driving context. Additionally, the response lacks clarity and coherence, with grammatical errors and unclear reasoning. Overall, the predicted answer does not align with the correct answer and lacks the necessary details for a precise driving prediction.",
