    "A": "To determine the sequence of objects the ego vehicle should notice and the corresponding actions, let's analyze the images:\n\n1. **First Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT\n   - **Object:** Pedestrian or cyclist near the sidewalk.\n   - **State:** Stationary or moving slowly.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop if the pedestrian or cyclist moves into the road.\n\n2. **Second Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_FRONT_RIGHT\n   - **Object:** Parked cars on the right side.\n   - **State:** Stationary.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and be cautious of any potential movement from these parked cars.\n\n3. **Third Object:**\n   - **Camera:** CAM_BACK\n   - **Object:** Approaching vehicle from behind.\n   - **State:** Moving towards the ego vehicle.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should maintain its lane and speed, ensuring not to brake suddenly, allowing the vehicle behind to pass safely if needed.\n\nThese observations and actions ensure the ego vehicle navigates safely through the environment by prioritizing potential hazards and maintaining awareness of its surroundings.",

    "rubric-aware": "1. Object Identification and Priority Order (20 points): 5\n2. Object Category and Visual Description Accuracy (20 points): 5\n3. State of the Object (15 points): 5\n4. Recommended Action for Ego Vehicle (15 points): 5\n5. Logical Flow and Reasonableness of Prediction (20 points): 5\n6. Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 5\nTotal Score: 30\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not accurately identify the correct objects in the correct priority order, nor does it provide the recommended actions for the ego vehicle in response to each object. The object category and visual description accuracy are also lacking, and the logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are not aligned with the driving context. Additionally, the clarity and grammar of the response are unclear and lack coherence. Therefore, the predicted answer receives a low score of 30.",

The recommended actions for the ego vehicle are appropriate and logical. However, the predicted answer does not align with the correct priority order of objects as indicated in the question, resulting in a lower score. Additionally, the response lacks the specific priority order and actions requested in the question, impacting the overall score."
