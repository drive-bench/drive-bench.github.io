    "A": "The moving status of object (c2,CAM_FRONT,0.4651,0.5658) is C. Turn right.\n Explanation: The object is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image, and its orientation suggests it is in the process of turning right.",
    "baseline": "10",
    "rubric-aware": "1. Answer Correctness (50 points): 0 points\n 2. Object Recognition (10 points): 5 points\n 3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points): 2 points\n 4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0 points\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 3 points\n Total Score: 10\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer incorrectly identifies the object's movement as \"turn right\" when the correct answer is \"turn left.\" The object recognition is accurate, but the description of the object's location and orientation is not precise. There is no consideration of environmental conditions, and the reasoning is somewhat clear but contains inaccuracies. Overall, the score is low due to the major error in answer correctness and lack of consideration for environmental conditions.",

Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0\n 5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2\n Total Score: 7\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. Object Recognition and Object Location and Orientation are partially accurate, but there are inaccuracies and omissions, resulting in low scores. Environmental Condition Awareness is not addressed, resulting in a score of 0. The Clarity of Reasoning is also lacking, with a score of 2. Overall, the explanation does not align well with the correct answer and lacks clarity and awareness of environmental conditions, resulting in a low total score of 7.",
