Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\n Total Score: 15\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer correctly identifies the object's position and orientation in the scene, earning full points for object recognition and location and orientation. The reasoning is clear and logically structured, with no grammatical issues, earning full points for clarity of reasoning. However, the predicted answer does not align with the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for answer correctness. Additionally, there is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in a score of 0 for environmental condition awareness. Therefore, the total score is 15.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2\n Total Score: 6\n \n Brief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. The object recognition, location, and reasoning are all somewhat accurate, but there are inaccuracies and omissions that prevent a higher score. Additionally, there is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in a low score in that category. The explanation is somewhat clear but lacks precision and coherence, leading to a low score in Clarity of Reasoning. Overall, the predicted answer and explanation do not align well with the correct answer and lack thoroughness, resulting in a low total score of 6.",
