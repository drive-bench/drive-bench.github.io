Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5 points\nTotal Score: 15\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer accurately identifies the object and its location and orientation in the scene. The reasoning is clear and logically structured. However, the predicted answer does not match the correct answer, and there is no consideration of environmental conditions that could impact perception. Therefore, the total score is 15.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2\nTotal Score: 6\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. The object recognition, location, and environmental condition awareness are all lacking in accuracy and detail, resulting in low scores for those criteria as well. The reasoning is somewhat clear, but the overall explanation does not align well with the correct answer and lacks important contextual details.",
    "context-aware": "1. Answer Correctness (50 points): 0 points\n2. Object Recognition (10 points): 2 points\n3. Object Location and Orientation (15 points): 3 points\n4. Environmental Condition Awareness (15 points): 0 points\n5. Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 2 points\nTotal Score: 7/100\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in 0 points for Answer Correctness. The object recognition and location and orientation are partially accurate, earning 2 and 3 points respectively. However, there is no consideration for environmental conditions, resulting in 0 points. The reasoning is somewhat clear, but there are some issues with clarity and logical structure, earning 2 points. Overall, the predicted answer lacks precision and fails to fully support the reasoning, resulting in a low score of 7 out of 100."
