    "A": "To determine the sequence of objects the ego vehicle should notice and the appropriate actions, let's analyze the images step by step:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed:**\n   - **Object:** The ego vehicle should first notice the **pedestrian** in the CAM_FRONT_RIGHT image.\n   - **State:** The pedestrian is standing near the curb, possibly waiting to cross the street.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should **slow down** and prepare to stop if necessary to ensure the pedestrian's safety.\n\n2. **Second Object Noticed:**\n   - **Object:** The ego vehicle should then notice the **parked cars** in the CAM_BACK_RIGHT image.\n   - **State:** The parked cars are stationary and do not pose an immediate threat.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the parked cars and be prepared for any sudden movements (e.g., a car door opening).\n\n3. **Third Object Noticed:**\n   - **Object:** The ego vehicle should notice the **buildings** in the CAM_FRONT_LEFT and CAM_FRONT_RIGHT images.\n   - **State:** The buildings are stationary and do not pose a direct threat to the ego vehicle.\n   - **Action:** The ego vehicle should continue to monitor the surroundings for any potential hazards and maintain a safe speed.\n\nIn summary:\n- **First:** Notice the pedestrian, slow down, and prepare to stop.\n- **Second:** Notice the parked cars, maintain a safe distance.\n- **Third:** Notice the buildings, monitor surroundings, and maintain a safe speed.",
