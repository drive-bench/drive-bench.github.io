    "A": "The moving status of object <c2,CAM_FRONT,0.4651,0.5658> is most likely: **B. Going ahead.**\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe object is positioned near the center of the image, which typically aligns with the lane markings indicating a forward path. The lane markings on the road also suggest a straight direction, supporting the conclusion that the object is moving straight ahead.",

Clarity of Reasoning (10 points): 5\nTotal Score: 15\n\nBrief Summary: The predicted answer does not match the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 for Answer Correctness. However, the explanation demonstrates accurate object recognition, clear reasoning, and consideration of object location and orientation, earning full points in those categories. Environmental condition awareness is lacking, resulting in a lower score in that category. Overall, the explanation is clear and well-supported, but the incorrect predicted answer significantly impacts the total score.",

Object Recognition is partially accurate, but there are some inaccuracies and omissions. Object Location and Orientation is well-described, earning full points. However, there is no consideration of environmental conditions, resulting in a score of 0 for that criterion. The reasoning is somewhat clear but lacks coherence and grammatical accuracy, resulting in a lower score for Clarity of Reasoning. Overall, the predicted answer and explanation do not align well with the correct answer and lack consideration of important factors, resulting in a low total score of 10.",
