    "A": "To analyze the driving scenario, let's examine the images and identify key objects and their states:\n 1. **First Object to Notice:**\n - **Object:** The vehicle in the CAM_FRONT image.\n - **State:** Stationary and parked.\n - **Action:** The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, ensuring there is enough space to maneuver around the parked vehicle.\n 2. **Second Object to Notice:**\n - **Object:** The vehicle in the CAM_FRONT_LEFT image.\n - **State:** Stationary and parked.\n - **Action:** The ego vehicle should continue to monitor for any movement or potential hazards as it navigates around parked vehicles.\n 3. **Third Object to Notice:**\n - **Object:** The vehicle in the CAM_BACK image.\n - **State:** Stationary and parked.\n - **Action:** The ego vehicle should ensure that it maintains a safe distance from parked vehicles while reversing or maneuvering in tight spaces.\n Overall, the ego vehicle should prioritize caution and awareness of its surroundings, particularly in a parking area with multiple stationary vehicles.",

    "rubric-aware": "1. Object Identification and Priority Order (20 points): 10\n 2. Object Category and Visual Description Accuracy (20 points): 12\n 3. State of the Object (15 points): 7\n 4. Recommended Action for Ego Vehicle (15 points): 10\n 5. Logical Flow and Reasonableness of Prediction (20 points): 12\n 6. Clarity and Grammar (10 points): 8\n Total Score: 59\n Brief Summary: The predicted answer correctly identifies the objects but does not maintain the correct priority order. The descriptions of the object category and visual attributes are somewhat accurate but lack specific details. The states of the objects are misjudged in some cases and a few recommended actions for the ego vehicle are not entirely accurate. The logical flow and reasonableness of the prediction are decent, but there are some inconsistencies. The clarity and grammar of the response are relatively good, with only minor issues in clarity and grammar.",
